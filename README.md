# NLP-Based Medical Question Answering System

## Overview
Developed an end-to-end NLP pipeline to process and answer medical questions using domain-specific datasets. Leveraged named entity recognition, information retrieval, and deep learning models for building a BERT-based QA engine.

## Tools Used
- Python
- SciSpacy (NER)
- Sentence-BERT (IR)
- BERT (QA)
- Matplotlib, WordCloud
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Skills Demonstrated
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Information Retrieval (IR)
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Transformer Models (BERT)
- Data Visualization

## Project Steps
1. Preprocessed MedQuAD dataset (medical Q&A corpus).
2. Implemented NER with SciSpacy to extract entities like diseases, drugs, organs.
3. Retrieved top relevant paragraphs using Sentence-BERT for semantic similarity.
4. Used BERT to generate context-specific answers.
5. Visualized most frequent keywords and diseases using bar charts and word clouds.

## Outcome
Built a robust medical QA system capable of extracting accurate answers from clinical literature. Showcased how transformer-based models outperform traditional NLP in understanding healthcare questions.
